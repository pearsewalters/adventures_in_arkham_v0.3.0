On her way to talk to one of her professors last month, she saw a painting in the hallway that captured her attention with its hazy depiction of some horrible creature rising up out of the ocean. Ever since, Amanda has heard strange whispers in a foreign language whenever her attention drifts. More disturbingly, she has begun to dream of the vast green depths of the ocean and terrible alien cities that lie in its darkest crevasses.\n\nThis evening, as she finishes her shift as a bank teller at the First Bank of Arkham, something out of the night calls to her-- something dark and sinister that leaves the feel of sea foam in her mind and makes her gasp with the effort of resisting it. Leaning against the brick wall of the bank, Amanda realizes that she has to find out what's happening to her or she's going to fall prey to whatever alien presence is invading her mind.",             'base'      ],

Now, after witnessing Father Michael's strange mood swings and seeing some of the bizarre practices that go on in this town, she's beginning to feel that she may have been a bit too hasty ...\n\nFor instance, last night, there was a knock on the door of the church, and when she answered it, there was nothing but a handwritten journal laying on the steps outside. Reading it, she learned of strange cults and terrible creatures that lurk in the darkness. Worse, when she laughingly showed it to Father Michael, he turned pale and threw it into the fire, yelling at her to forget what she'd seen.\n\nNow, gathering her things and quietly leaving South Church, Sister Mary has decided to investigate this town, and in so doing, reaffirm her faith.", 'base'      ],
