On her way to talk to one of her professors last month, she saw a painting in the hallway that captured her attention with its hazy depiction of some horrible creature rising up out of the ocean. Ever since, Amanda has heard strange whispers in a foreign language whenever her attention drifts. More disturbingly, she has begun to dream of the vast green depths of the ocean and terrible alien cities that lie in its darkest crevasses.\n\nThis evening, as she finishes her shift as a bank teller at the First Bank of Arkham, something out of the night calls to her-- something dark and sinister that leaves the feel of sea foam in her mind and makes her gasp with the effort of resisting it. Leaning against the brick wall of the bank, Amanda realizes that she has to find out what's happening to her or she's going to fall prey to whatever alien presence is invading her mind.", 'base'],

His nightmares have been growing steadily worse over the last month, driving him all the way here... to Arkham. Even the whiskey isn't helping much anymore. Soon, he won't be able to sleep at all.
